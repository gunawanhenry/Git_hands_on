DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------
File list (filenames, directory structure (for zipped files) and brief description of all data files):
(Not specified in the document. Data files likely include CT scan images, direct shear test results, and geochemical analysis data from the GeoB14403 core samples.)

Relationship between files, if important for context:
The dataset consists of multiple data types, including CT scan images, direct-shear experiment results, petrophysical measurements, and geochemical logs. These data are complementary, providing an integrated analysis of the mechanical and structural properties of the volcanoclastic layer and surrounding sediments.

Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package:
Additional geophysical and sedimentological data from RV Maria S. Merian cruise MSM15/3, including multibeam bathymetry, Parasound profiles, and sediment cores, may exist but are not explicitly included in this dataset.

If data was derived from another source, list source:
This dataset is based on original core samples obtained from site GeoB14403 during RV Maria S. Merian cruise MSM15/3 (2010). Some background references include previous studies on the Gela Basin (e.g., Minisini et al., 2007; Kuhlmann et al., 2014, 2015).

If there are multiple versions of the dataset, list the file updated, when and why update was made:

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------
**Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:**  
Sediment core samples were collected from site **GeoB14403** in the **Gela Basin, Strait of Sicily**, during the *RV Maria S. Merian* cruise **MSM15/3** in **March 2010** using the **Bremen seafloor drill rig MeBo** (Freudenthal & Wefer, 2007, 2013).  
- Acoustic data was obtained using a **parametric sediment echosounder (Atlas Parasound, 4 kHz)** and **multibeam echosounders (Kongsberg Simrad EM120 and EM1002, operating at 12 kHz and 95 kHz, respectively).**  
- Core-physical properties were measured using a **GEOTEK Ltd. Multi-Sensor Core Logger (MSCL).**  
- Geochemical composition (Al to Fe) was analyzed using an **Avaatech II core scanner** at 10 kV, 0.2 mA, and a sampling time of 20 s.

**Methods for processing the data:**  
- **CT scanning:** A **Toshiba Aquilion 64 computer tomograph** was used at **Klinikum Bremen-Mitte** to obtain 3D structural imaging of the cores at **120 kV, 600 mA, and 0.35 mm x-y resolution with 0.5 mm z resolution.**  
- **Direct-shear experiments:** Conducted on cylindrical WR samples (**56 mm diameter, ~25 mm height**) using a **GIESA RS5 device**, under a **constant effective normal stress of 192 kPa** to match in situ conditions.  
- **Geochemical and petrophysical analysis:** XRF scanning and density measurements were performed to identify material transitions and mesoporosity in sediment layers.  

**Software- or Instrument-specific information needed to interpret the data, including software and hardware version numbers:**  
- **CT scan data** requires medical imaging software supporting **DICOM format**, e.g., **OsiriX, ImageJ, or Avizo.**  
- **Shear test data** is recorded and analyzed using software compatible with the **GIESA RS5** system.  
- **Geochemical data** processed with **Avaatech II core scanner software**.  

**Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:**  
- **Shear tests followed** DIN 18137-3 standards (*Direct shear test for soil investigation and testing*).  
- **XRF calibration based on** internal standardization for elements **Al to Fe**.  
- **CT scan calibration performed using** Hounsfield units (HU) for sediment density analysis.  

**Environmental/experimental conditions:**  
- **Sediment samples were collected from ~28.2 meters below the seafloor** under **submarine slope stability conditions.**  
- **Shear tests were conducted under drained conditions**, simulating in situ stress levels.  
- **CT scan analysis performed under controlled laboratory conditions** at Klinikum Bremen-Mitte.  

**Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:**  
- **Duplicate XRF and density measurements** were taken to ensure accuracy.  
- **CT scans were cross-validated with sedimentological observations** to confirm internal structures.  
- **Direct-shear experiments followed standardized protocols (DIN 18137-3).**  

**People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis, and/or submission:**  
- **Sample collection:** J. Kuhlmann, K. Huhn, M.J. Ikari (MARUM – University of Bremen).  
- **Processing and analysis:** J. Kuhlmann (CT scans, geochemical analysis), G. Wiemer (shear box experiments), J. Titschack (CT data support).  
- **Submission and dataset curation:** J. Kuhlmann (Corresponding author: jkuhlmann@marum.de).
