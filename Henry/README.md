# Git Hands-on Session

## Assignment

In the Git crash course (slides available via [1]), you have seen the fundamentals of version control and Git and learned essential commands for managing GitHub repositories. Now, it's time to put that knowledge into practice with a collaborative, hands-on excerise. In the POSEIDON project space [2] or SURF drive [3] if you still cannot access UniShare, you will find three sample datasets in the sub-directory `numerical_data` and `laboratory_data`.

The assignment is to form three groups to visualize, analyze, and document insights from these datasets. For data visualization and analysis, you can use the programming language of your choice. For those who would like to work on data documentation (metadata), you can find a nice example in [4]. Each group should ideally include members with varying levels of experience in programming and Git to facilitate collaboration.

## Learning goals
- Gain hands-on experience with Git using POSEIDON-relevant datasets.
- Identify (and develop) reusable utility functions within your group and across different work packages.
- Strengthen collaboration skills by working with team members from diverse programming and Git backgrounds.
- Identify common toolsets (per and across work packages): which programming languages, which packages, and which platform?
- Become familiar with Open Science practices such as version control, virtual environments, and documentation.

## Your deliverables:
After completing the assignment, each group will give a presentation (8 minutes max) on the following:
- Git repositories pushed to https://github.com/orgs/POSEIDON-DN/repositories, containing all the commits (and branches). 
- Show your interpretation of the datasets through visualization, data processing, or by deriving meaningful results.
- Demonstrate how your group coordinated tasks using Git. Highlight aspects like branching, commits, and merging workflows if possible.
- Reflect on what your group has learned from working with the data and Git collaboratively. Discuss how these skills can be applied to your DC project.

## Preparation checklist
- Make sure your internet connection is smooth
- Install Git on your computer (page 5 of [1])
- Create your Github account
- Set up SSH keys (page 6-7 of [1])
